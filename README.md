# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository was to use APIs from Google and OpenWeather to create dataframes based on randomized coordinates created using the random number generator in Python.

## Summary

### Process

After randomly generating 2,000 sets of coordinates we used the OpenWeather API to gather the current weather data for major cities near the coordinates. Afterward we asked a customer to input data as to what temperatures they would prefer to find if they were to go on a trip. The range input reduced the number of cities that could be traveled to, and we were tasked with choosing four cities out of the group and making an itinerary with it. Those locations were fed into a google map figure to give us pins and directions to follow for our vacation.
